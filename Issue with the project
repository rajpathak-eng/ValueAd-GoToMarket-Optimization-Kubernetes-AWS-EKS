## The Problem

### Deployment Bottleneck ⛔

Our initial analysis revealed that deploying Value-Ad's lead intelligence platform was quite a bottleneck. Each client's stack required manual deployment on a group of 4-5 EC2 instances. This process was resource-intensive, and Value-Ad was paying for unused CPU and memory.

## What the Client Wants

### Faster Deployment 🚀

Value-Ad is on a mission to speed things up. They're looking for a way to deploy their client stacks rapidly, going from weeks to just minutes. They want to leverage the power of AWS resources more efficiently, optimizing their deployment process.

### Cost Savings 💰

Costs matter, and Value-Ad aims to reduce them significantly. They're seeking a solution that can cut down deployment costs by as much as 80%, so they can allocate resources more effectively.

### Scalability and Reliability 🌐

The client values scalability and reliability. They want a system that can scale each client's app effortlessly and distribute it across different availability zones. Reliability is key to serving clients like PRUDENTIAL, DBS, and TELSTRA.
